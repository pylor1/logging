## Logging Disambiguation
Developers and others use the word 'logging' in many ways, most of which are both vague and ambiguous.
This section discusses what is, and what is not, meant here by 'logging'.
There is also a small note on the origin of the term.


Logs of the following kind are not part of this discussion:

. Database Logs (transaction logs)
. Access Control Logs (logins)
. Functional Logs such as telemetry data, weather, bore hole, and so on (borehole logs)
. Critical information for System Operators or Administrators (exceptions and failures)


# Best Practice?
Not wishing to hide behind thought-stopping clich&#233;s we shall not discuss 'best practice' beyond refusing to entertain the idea and providing a word or two on why.

For there to exist any 'best practice' there must be:

. specific, explicit requirements that must be met
. proof, or at least substantial evidence that the above requirements match the requirements at hand
. an enumeration of all practices that could apply
. an agreed, non-contentious, metric, that can and has provided an order relation on all practices
. proof or at least substantial evidence that the 'best practice' has been assessed by the agreed metric and found to be superior to all other practices


# Etymology
As an aside and for interest only, an brief description of how the word 'log' came to be so confused.

A wood log would be thrown over the side, near the bow, of a ship and the time it took to pass a point aft, would indicate the speed of the ship through the water.
This became a special purpose piece of wood attached to a knotted rope that would be payed out for a set time and the number of knots that were payed out indicated the speed, in knots, of the ship.

The speed would be recorded in a log book and would help reckon the distance travelled.
